/***
 * The searching algorithms are used to search or find one or more than one element from a dataset.
 * These type of algorithms are used to find elements from a specific data structures.
 * Searching may be sequential or not. If the data in the dataset are random, then we need to use
 * sequential searching. Otherwise, we can use other different techniques to reduce the complexity.
 * Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of
 * algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing
 *
 * Types of Searches:
 *     - Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element
 *       is checked. For example: Linear Search
 *     - Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted
 *       data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear
 *       Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search
 *       space in half. For Example: Binary Search

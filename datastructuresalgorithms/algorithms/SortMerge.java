/***
 * The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm.
 * In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves, and then they are combined
 * in a sorted manner
 * Think of it as a recursive algorithm continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be
 * further divided. This means that if the array becomes empty or has only one element left, the
 * dividing will stop, i.e. it is the base case to stop the recursion. If the array has multiple
 * elements, split the array into halves and recursively invoke the merge sort on each of the halves.
 * Finally, when both halves are sorted, the merge operation is applied. Merge operation is the process
 * of taking two smaller sorted arrays and combining them to eventually make a larger one
 *
 * Steps to solve the problem:
 *     - mergeSort(arr[], left, right)
 *     - If right > left
 *     - Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves: middle m = left + (right â€“ left)/2
 *     - Call mergeSort for first half: mergeSort(arr, left, m)
 *     - Call mergeSort for second half: mergeSort(arr, m + 1, right)
 *     - Merge the two halves sorted merge(arr, left, m, right)
 *
 *  * Properties:
 *     - Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists.
 *     - Merge Sort is a stable sort which means that the same element in an array maintain their
 *       original positions with respect to each other.
 *     - Overall time complexity of Merge sort is O(nLogn). It is more efficient as it is in worst
 *       case also the runtime is O(nlogn)
 *     - The space complexity of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of
 *       space and may slower down operations for the last data sets.
 *
 * Applications:
 *     - Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists in O(n Log n) time
 *     - Merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists
 *     - Merge sort is used for counting inversions in a list
 *     - Merge sort is used in external sorting
 *
 * Performance:
 *     - Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n*log n)
 *     - Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n*log n)
 *     - Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n*log n)
 *     - Space Complexity: O(n)
 *
 * Advantages:
 *     - Merge sort can efficiently sort a list in O(n*log(n)) time
 *     - Fast for large arrays unlike selection, insertion, and bubble sort it doesn't go through the
 *       whole array many times
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 *     - For small datasets, merge sort is slower than other sorting algorithms
 *     - For the temporary array, mergesort requires an additional space of O(n)
 *     - Even if the array is sorted, the merge sort goes through the entire process

/***
 * Shell sort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort, we move elements only one
 * position ahead. When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of
 * ShellSort is to allow the exchange of far items. In Shell sort, we make the array gap-sorted for a
 * large value of gap. We keep reducing the value of gap until it becomes 1. An array is said to be
 * gap-sorted if all sublists of every gapâ€™th element are sorted.
 *
 * Steps to solve the problem:
 *     - Initialize the value of gap size. Example: gap
 *     - Divide the list into smaller sub-part. Each must have equal intervals to gap
 *     - Sort these sub-lists using insertion sort
 *     - Repeat this step 2 until the list is sorted and gap size is 1
 *
 * Properties:
 *     - Comparison-based sorting technique
 *     - Inplace sorting technique just like insertion sort
 *     - Works very well for medium-sized datasets
 *     - Unstable sorting technique
 *
 * Applications:
 *     - Shell sort is a replacement of insertion sort when insertion sort is taking too much execution
 *       time
 *     - We use shell sort when the call of the stack is overhead
 *     - Shell sort is applicable when recursion exceeds a particular limit
 *
 * Performance:
 *     - Worst Case Complexity: less than or equal to O(n2)
 *     - Best Case Complexity: O(n*log n)
 *     - Average Case Complexity: O(n*log n) It is around O(n1.25).
 *     - Note: The complexity depends on the interval chosen. The above complexities differ for
 *       different increment sequences chosen. Best increment sequence is unknown
 *
 * Advantages:
 *     - Shell sort algorithm is only efficient for finite number of elements in an array
 *     - Shell sort algorithm is 5.32 x faster than bubble sort algorithm
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 *     - Shell sort algorithm is complex in structure and bit more difficult to understand
 *     - Shell sort algorithm is significantly slower than the merge sort, quick sort and heap sort
 *       algorithms

/***
 * A data structure is a specialized format to organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
 * They are designed by composing data elements into logical unit representing an abstract data type that has
 * relevance to the algorithm or application.

 * Questions to consider when choosing a data structure:
 *     - What kind of information will be stored
 *     - How will that information be used
 *     - Where should data persist, or be kept, after it is created
 *     - What aspects of memory and storage reservation management should be considered

 * DS use cases:
 *     - Storing, Ordering, Indexing, Searching

 * DS types:
 *     - Homogeneous : data items are of the same type
 *     - Heterogeneous : data items are of the various types

 *     - Static : have fixed sizes
 *     - Dynamic : have various sizes

 *     - Primitive : defined by the programming languages, built-in
 *         > Integer, Float, Character, Boolean

 *     - Non-primitive : created using the primitive data structures
 *         > Linear : data items are arranged in sequential order
 *             >> Array, Stack, Queue, LinkedList
 *         > Non-linear : data items are arranged in unordered sequence
 *             >> Tree, Graph, Trie, HashTable
